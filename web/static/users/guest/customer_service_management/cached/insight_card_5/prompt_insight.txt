You are trying to answer a question based on information provided by a data scientist.

Given the meta information:
<meta>
    <description>The dataset captures customer service management cases, including details on case durations, assignments, escalations, and SLAs. Potential trends include case resolution efficiency, SLA compliance, and the impact of escalations, priority, and outages on service performance.</description>
<goal>Optimize service efficiency and resolution times.</goal>
<persona>CSM efficiency and performance evaluator.</persona>

<question>How does the average time taken to close cases compare to the average resolution time?</question>

Instructions:
* Based on the analysis and other information provided above, write an answer to the question enclosed with <question></question> tags.
* The answer should be a single sentence, but it should not be too high level and should include the key details from justification.

* Each of the tags should be in a new line and should only contain one sentence
* Make sure all generated text easy to read and understand so it should be in laymans terms
* Make sure all generated text is concise
* Make sure you are very quantitative in your responses
* For the severity, whether it is clear, low, medium, or high, it depends on how far the insight is from a dangerous threshold
* The output for the <insight> tag should explain an interesting discovery from the plot_summary that is grounded by the meta data, the question and the indicators and include any potential concerns if there are, otherwise say how it is not concerning
* The output for the <insight> tag should not offer any advice on what to do next

<answer>This contains a direct answer to the given question</answer>
<header>A 7 word max header that summarizes the insight's concern or lack thereof and it should be a meaningful statement</header>
<plot_summary>This contains a summary of the plot</plot_summary>
<insight>This should contain the answer and also explain an interesting discovery from the plot_summary that is grounded by the meta data, the question and the indicators and explain why is it concerning or why is it not concerning. Do not offer advice on what to do next</insight>
<indicator>Specify which indicator has been triggered or almost triggered by this plot summary or answer and give a one line explanation</indicator>
<score>a score between 0 and 100 about how interesting and actionable this insight is</score>
<followup>this should contain a follow up question to explore the insight further and should be easily answerable from the dataset through basic data analytics</followup>
