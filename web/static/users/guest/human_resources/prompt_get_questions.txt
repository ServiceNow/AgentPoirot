## Do not repeat anything similar to these past questions:
<past_questions>
['Give me an overview of this dataset.', 'What is the average performance rating by department?']
</past_questions>

## Instructions:
* Write a list of questions to be solved by the data scientists in your team to explore my data and reach my goal.
* Explore diverse aspects of the data, and ask questions that are relevant to my goal.
* You must ask the right questions to surface anything interesting (trends, anomalies, etc.)
* Make sure these can realistically be answered based on the data schema.
* The insights that your team will extract will be used to generate a report.
* Each question should only have one part, that is a single '?' at the end which only require a single answer.
* Do not number the questions.
* You can produce at most 1 questions. Stop generation after that.
* score should be between 0 and 100 indicating the importance of the question to extract interesting insights for the goal
* justication should be a short sentence explaining why the question is important
* type should be either descriptive, diagnostic, prescriptive, or predictive
* add columns to consider for the question
* Most importantly, each question must be enclosed within <container><columns></columns><question></question<justification></justification><score></score><type></type></container> tags. Refer to the example response below:

Example response:
<container><question>What is the average age of the customers?</question><justification>Age is an important factor in determining customer preferences.</justification><score>80</score><type>descriptive</type><columns>age,name</columns></container>
<container><question>What is the distribution of the customers based on their age?</question><justification>Understanding the age distribution can help in targeting specific age groups.</justification><score>70</score><type>descriptive</type><columns>age,name</columns></container>
