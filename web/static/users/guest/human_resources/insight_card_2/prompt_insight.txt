Given the dataset sample:
<data_sample>
    [{'employee_id': 1.0, 'first_name': 'Ian', 'last_name': 'Rodriguez', 'department': 'HR', 'job_title': 'Senior Developer'}, {'employee_id': 2.0, 'first_name': 'Juan', 'last_name': 'Cruz', 'department': 'Sales', 'job_title': 'Senior Developer'}, {'employee_id': 3.0, 'first_name': 'Michael', 'last_name': 'Miller', 'department': 'Operations', 'job_title': 'Data Analyst'}, {'employee_id': 4.0, 'first_name': 'David', 'last_name': 'Reid', 'department': 'HR', 'job_title': 'Senior Developer'}, {'employee_id': 5.0, 'first_name': 'Tracey', 'last_name': 'Keller', 'department': 'Operations', 'job_title': 'Junior Developer'}]
</data_sample>

Instructions:
* Based on the stats, data_sample and other information provided above, write an answer to the question enclosed with <question></question> tags.
* The answer should be a single sentence, but it should not be too high level and should include the key details from justification.
* Write your answer in HTML-like tags using all the tags in the example response below.
* Refer to the following example response for the format of the answer and justification.
* make sure to use the descriptions provided in the Example response below
* Each of the tags should be in a new line and should only contain one sentence
* Make sure all generated text is concise, easy to read and understand so it should be in laymans terms
* Make sure you are very quantitative in your responses
* For the severity, whether it is clear, low, medium, or high, it depends on how far the insight is from a dangerous threshold
* something surprising would be like an interesting correlation or a trend that is unexpected
* see how factors relate to each other and whether things are consistent or out of the ordinary 
* The output for the <insight> tag should explain an interesting, surprising discovery of a trend or insight from the data_sample and the stats, the indicators and include any potential concerns if there are, otherwise say how it is not concerning
* The output for the <insight> tag should be very specific and should use as many numbers as possible
* The output for the <header> should summarize the biggest takeaway from the insight


Example response:
<answer>This contains a direct answer to the given question</answer>
<header>A 7 word max header that summarizes the insight's concern or lack thereof and it should be a meaningful statement</header>
<insight>This should explain an interesting discovery from the stats and the data_sample that is grounded by the meta data, and the indicators and explain why is it concerning or why is it not concerning. Do not offer advice on what to do next</insight>
<indicator>Specify which indicator has been triggered or almost triggered by the findings and give a one line explanation</indicator>
<score>a score between 0 and 100 about how interesting and actionable this insight is</score>
<followup>this should contain a follow up question to explore the insight further and should be easily answerable from the dataset through basic data analytics</followup>
<severity>this should be a single word which is one of these (clear, low, medium, high)</severity>
