### üì• Install Library

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/ServiceNow/agent-poirot
```

### üöÄ Usage

#### 1. Get Insights

```python
import pandas as pd
import agentpoirot


# Load Data
sales_by_country = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "State": ["California", "Texas", "Florida", "New York", "Alaska"],
        "Sales": [50000, 45000, 40000, 42000, 100000],
        "Customers": [
            500,
            450,
            400,
            420,
            50,
        ],
    }
)

# set your openai api key
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get Agent
agent = agentpoirot.Poirot(
    table=sales_by_country,
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    meta_dict={
        "goal": "find surprising insights in terms of how factors are correlated",
    },
)

# Generate Insights
insights = agent.generate_insights(n_insights=1, as_str=True)
print(insights)
```

#### Output:
```
# Insight 1
## Header
-----------
Inverse correlation between sales and customers observed

## Question
-----------
How do sales correlate with the number of customers across different states?

## Answer
-----------
Sales and customer numbers show a surprising inverse correlation in some states.

## Insight
-----------
In California, with 500 customers, sales are at $50,000, while in Alaska, only 50 customers lead to an unexpected spike in sales to $100,000, indicating a potential anomaly in customer purchasing behavior that could warrant further investigation.

## Severity
-----------
medium

## Follow up
-----------
What is the average sales per customer for each state?
```

#### 2. Ask Questions and Get Insight

A question can also be asked to the agent and the agent will generate an insight.

```python
question = "What is an interesting trend between these countries?"
insights = agent.answer_question(question=question)
print(insights)
```

#### 3. Run main.py to generate insights for a dataset

```bash
python main.py --dataset_name <dataset_name> 
               --model_name <model_name>
               --openai_api_key <openai_api_key>
               --savedir_base <savedir_base>
```

## 2. Run  Web App
```
cd web
python app.py
```
