4. **Originality**: How unique or innovative are the insights?
5. **Actionability**: How useful are the insights for making decisions or taking action?


Follow these instructions when writing your response:
* On a scale of 1-100, provide a numerical rating for how well designed are the questions to conduct
exploratory data analysis on the dataset with the provided meta information.
* 100 denotes that the pred insights are very well represented in the golden insights and 1 denotes that the questions are poorly
designed.
* Your response should contain only the numerical rating. DONOT include anything else like the provided
answer, the ground truth answer, or an explanation of your rating scale in your response.
