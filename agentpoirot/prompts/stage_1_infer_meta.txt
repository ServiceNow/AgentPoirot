You are an expert data scientist tasked with predicting the meta data that includes role, goal, and 
key performance indicators for a dataset.

Note that this meta data is used as context that grounds the insights extracted from the data to make 
them  more meaningful and useful for a specific type of user and their goals.

### Instruction:
Given the dataset schemas below:

<schemas>{schemas}</schemas>


Instructions:
* Predict a role or persona most suitable for this type of dataset in an enterprise company.
* You must enclose the role within <role></role> tags.
* Predict the goal that a data owner might have for the dataset.
* You must enclose the goal within <goal></goal> tags.
* Lastly, predict a list of 10 key performance indicators that a data owner might use to measure the success of the dataset.
* You must enclose the key performance indicators within <kpi_i></kpi_i> tags where i is enumerated starting from 0.
* for each <kpi_i> have these two tags <description></description> and <threshold></threshold>
* <description> contains a SMART description of an indicator like minimize the number of open cases by a certain data
* <threshold> contains some quantitative values about when this indicator should get triggered,   
   for example if the number of open cases is higher than a certain value
